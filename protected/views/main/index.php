	keep track of in-game aspects, or anything else you want to remember about the game.</p>

	Don't forget to check out the forums. Put in your two cents on gaming topics being discussed there.
	People will see your posts and check out your wall. Your wall shows many things about your gaming life. 
	Things such as; how many games you've beaten, how many games you own, what you are currently playing, 
	your friends and followers, and even your wall posts.
